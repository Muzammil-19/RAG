This is a sample document for testing text extraction and chunking in a chatbot application. The goal is to load this document, split it into smaller chunks, and use it for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This document contains multiple sentences to simulate a real-world scenario where users upload files for AI-driven question answering. By processing this text, we can ensure the chatbot correctly handles document-based inputs. Additionally, handling various file formats like PDFs is crucial for real-world applications. This simple document serves as a test case for document-based AI models, ensuring efficient text extraction and chunking.
